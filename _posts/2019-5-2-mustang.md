			<h3>Role:</h3>
			<p>Creative Developer</p>
			
			<h3>Development stack:</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>WebGL / Three.js</li>
				<li>Javascript</li>
				<li>GLSL shaders</li>
			</ul>

		<p>
			The Ford Mustang web app was a colaborative project between AKQA and The Mill.
			<br><br>
			It was built using WebGL and the Three.js framework to speed up Development. We were a team of 3 Developers who were tasked with building
			a web app where users could create completely unique logo designers by dragging their finger over a power gauge.
			<br><br>
			In order for this to work, we each wrote custom GLSL shaders that used various noise paramaters in order to drive the random output.
			<br><br>
			Users were then able to take their designs and through the app, print their own merchandise such as a real car Emblem and mobile phone covers
