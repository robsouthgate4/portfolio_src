			The Mill Eggstractor web app was built as a fun easter competition for The Mill employees in easter 2018.
			<br><br>
			We only had 1 week to design and build so we had think fast and apply our learnings from previous projects to get it live and ready for the competition.
			<br><br>
			The key features include a custom, lightweight PBR shader written bespoke for the project. This meant we could apply the realistic foil material combined with the generative patterns that the user generated.
			<br><br>
			Users were able to download their designs and post them to Instagram using a specific hashtag so they were trackable by the marketing team. 
			<br><br>
			Below are screen grabs of the app in full flow.
