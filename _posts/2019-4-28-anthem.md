            With this Facebook Camera Lens for Anthemâ„¢, users were able to drop a Ranger into any space they wanted. 
            They could also flip the camera for a suited-up selfie inside the Ranger exosuit. The Helmet eyes light up and fire shoots from the character's jetpack
            in flight mode</p>            
            
            <p>
                The team optimised real game assets in order to get the effect within the 2mb limit and run smoothly cross all devices. <br>
                The jet pack was built using a custom GLSL shader placed on a cone shape. This was far more effective than using a sprite based system
                which would have been a big hit on filesize. <br>
                Finally there was bloom and camera shakes added through the PostProcessing shader inside of Spark AR.
